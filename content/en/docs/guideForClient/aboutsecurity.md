_Security checks whether Security Policy, Dependabot, CodeQL, Secret Scanning is enabled._

### Security Policy

**What is Security Policy?**

You can add a security policy to the repository to provide guidance on how to report security vulnerabilities in your project.

[More about Security Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository)

### Dependabot

**What is Dependabot?**

Dependabot creates Dependabot alerts when a known vulnerability is detected in the dependencies used by the project.

[More about Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts)

### CodeQL

**What is CodeQL?**

CodeQL can be used to identify vulnerabilities and errors in code. The result is displayed as code scanning warning in GitHub.

[More about CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql)

### Secret Scanning

**What is Secret Scanning?**

GitHub checks the repository for known types of secrets to prevent inadvertently committed secrets from being used for fraud.
