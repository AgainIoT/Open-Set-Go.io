### Security Policy
**What is Security Policy?**

You can add a security policy to the repository to provide guidance on how to report security vulnerabilities in your project.

### Dependabot

Dependabot creates Dependabot alerts when a known vulnerability is detected in the dependencies used by the project.

### CodeQL

CodeQL can be used to identify vulnerabilities and errors in code. The result is displayed as code scanning warning in GitHub.

### Secret Scanning
**What is Secret Scanning?**

GitHub checks the repository for known types of secrets to prevent inadvertently committed secrets from being used for fraud.
