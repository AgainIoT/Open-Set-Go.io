### For starting new Open-Source Project

It is not just to create a Source-Open Project, but to create a contribution-friendly environment and create an environment where communication between developers and contributors is smooth to create sustainable open source projects.
In addition, **Open-Set-Go** makes it easy, fast, and simple to build a contribution-friendly environment at the start of an open-source project.

### For continuing the open-source project

It provides an open-source operation review feature for three areas for the open-source project in progress.

- Template: Ensure that there are templates required to sustain open source. Using the features of Open-Set-Go, additional templates can be created to make pull-request requests.

- Security: Check whether the features provided by GitHub for the security of open-source projects are activated.

- Community: Check the elements needed to build an open-source community.
