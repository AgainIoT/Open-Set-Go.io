### Background of Development
---
All of AgainIoT's team members belong to the Kookmin University Society, which contributes to society through open source. When we first encountered the open source project through the conference, it seemed hopeless to create an environment where external developers wanted to contribute to the project beyond simply disclosing the source code. We thought other developers would be experiencing this hopelessness, so we decided to find out more about these problems.

In the British and American regions, not only public SW camps such as LINUX, but also companies such as Facebook and Twitter are active in open SW communities where developers can freely contribute. However, the OSS ecosystem has not yet been established in Korea. This situation is further raising barriers to entry for open SW.

Therefore, the ultimate goal of the Open-Set-Go project is to lower the entry barriers of open SW and to create tools to easily start open source projects.

### Purpose of Development
---
It is easy to find phrases such as "preferential treatment for experienced people related to open source" in corporate job openings. Through this, it can be seen that many companies are actively using open source and are looking for people with experience in open source to improve development productivity. Experience with open source is becoming important for developers, but experience for this is often difficult to even start due to various barriers. In addition, there are several additional functions that can be used at the start of an open source project. Since the creation and addition of elements through each function is a recommendation, the exact framework is not determined, and the process of setting them one by one may be cumbersome. Open-Set-Go aims to help start the project more easily through the steps of setting it along with providing references to recommended elements when creating a repository.

The ultimate goal of Open-Set-Go is to lower barriers to entry in open source, thereby growing projects into better software and contributing to society. If anyone can participate in the development by operating an open source project, the quality of the software can be improved through various test environments and error reporting.
