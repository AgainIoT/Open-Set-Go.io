### 2. Review

<img src="review.png">

There is a review function to evaluate whether an already created repository is suitable for an open-source project. Evaluate the 12 capabilities provided by the hub to build an open-source project environment in three categories. This evaluation of operations understands and enables these 12 factors to effectively run open-source projects.

**Summary** <img src="summary.png">

The Summary provides a brief summary of the results of the operational evaluation. You can select only the items you want and check them with a graph, or you can check the quantity of each item.
